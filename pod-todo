* hide pod, also in cperl
  - outline? OMGSLOW11 (no, really, *really*, *REALLY* slow)
  - folding? doesn't look bad, but apparently only does substring

  - hideshow? looks good. needs custom function for moving a block

* flymake hooks for podchecker
** hook in pod-mode, register in user conf
* Marking L<links> to be able to open them with C-c C-o

  - how's that section i want to link to actually called?
* indenting of verbatim paras
  - will be fixed with pod-cperl-mode by using cperl in verbatim
* Custom faces for headings
  - sort of like in latex-mode
