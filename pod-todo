* hide pod, also in cperl
  - outline? OMGSLOW11 (no, really, *really*, *REALLY* slow)
  - folding? doesn't look bad, but apparently only does substring
    matching, so can't do /^=cut/ et al properly
  - hideshow? looks good. needs custom function for moving a block
    forward. c.f. [[http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dotnetinterop/archive/2008/04/14/making-hideshow-el-work-with-csharp-mode-el-and-region-endregion.aspx][HideShow for C# regions]]
  - [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/HideIfDef][HideIfDef]] does something similar
  - [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/HideRegion][HideRegion]]
  - [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/HideLines][HideLines]]
  - [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/HighLight][HighLight]] also implements some sort of hiding, but is quite likely
    not exactly what i want
* automatic pod escape generation
* completion lowercases the word being completed
  - very annoying when completion module names
  - solve by using another completer? hippie expand?
* flymake hooks for podchecker
** hook in pod-mode, register in user conf
* Marking L<links> to be able to open them with C-c C-o
** L<> stuff already exists
** parse to link -> local keybinding in pod mode
* indenting of verbatim paras
  - will be fixed with pod-cperl-mode by using cperl in verbatim
* flyspell improvements
** filter stuff before passing it on to ispell
   - pod escapes and shit aren't errors
   - massive suck. flyspell insists on parsing itself, and only has
     two builtin parsers for normal text and tex.
* nested commands without different quote chars
