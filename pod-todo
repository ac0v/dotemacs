* hide pod, also in cperl
  - outline mode works fine in pod-mode, except it's really slow with
    linum-mode enabled
* automatic pod escape generation
* flymake hooks for podchecker
** hook in pod-mode, register in user conf
* Marking L<links> to be able to open them with C-c C-o
** L<> stuff already exists
** parse to link -> local keybinding in pod mode
* indenting of verbatim paras
  - will be fixed with pod-cperl-mode by using cperl in verbatim
* flyspell improvements
** filter stuff before passing it on to ispell
   - pod escapes and shit aren't errors
   - massive suck. flyspell insists on parsing itself, and only has
     two builtin parsers for normal text and tex.
* nested commands without different quote chars
  - C<I<username>@B<machine>>

* remove duplicated code in dynamic highlighting/outline/imenu with weaver words

* git commit needs a way to "close" a frame, or something

for both emacs and emacsclient
