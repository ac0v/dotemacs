* C-p in minibuffer, sometimes. M-x buffer is one example.
* implicit make-directory for found files in new dirs
  - only with confirmation
* improve startup time
** byte compile
   - not a huge win
** concat files
** more autoload-ing
* make read-only buffer writable to
  - safe somewhere else later
  - forcefully overwrite
* global command history
* auto-enable org-mode for TODO
  - seems to be working for "foo-todo" files already, but not "TODO"
